ðŸŸ¥ **Project 1** :
**Inverse kinematics for 6DOF manipulator using Rviz.**  Manipulator follows polynomial trajectory in every joint, and reaches given point in the space in 3s.

ðŸŸ¥ **Project 2**:
**Using Gazebo and prebuilt model of a manipulator to complete simple pick and place task.** Using two LiDAR's location of the object is determined. Next using ros2_control package and inverse kinematics appropriate joint configuration is being prescribed to the robot in Gazebo using gz_ros2_control. Finally robot uses it's gripper to pick and then places object in the desired location.
