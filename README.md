ðŸŸ¥ **Project 1** :
** Inverse kinematics for 6DOF manipulator using Rviz.**  Manipulator follows polynomial trajectory in every joint, and reaches given point in the space in 3s.

ðŸŸ¥ **Project 2**:
** Using Gazebo and prebuilt model of a manipulator to complete simple pick and place task. ** Over robot's workspace camera is mounted, which will help to recognize packages orienation and its color. Robot's gripper will pick them up accordingly and place in apropriate place according to the color of the box.
