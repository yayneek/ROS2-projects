ðŸŸ¥ **Project 1** :
**Inverse kinematics for 6DOF manipulator using Rviz.**  Manipulator follows polynomial trajectory in every joint, and reaches given point in the space in 3s.

ðŸŸ¥ **Project 2**:
**Using Gazebo and prebuilt model of a manipulator to complete simple pick and place task.** Using two LiDAR's location of the object is determined. Next using ros2_control package and inverse dynamics appropriate joint configuration is being prescribed to the robot in gazebo. Finally robot uses it's gripper to pick and then places object in the desired location.
